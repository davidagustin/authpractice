# âœ¨ Add Version Tagging Feature

## Description
This PR adds a comprehensive version management system to the AuthPractice project, including:

- **Version Management Script**: A new `scripts/version.sh` script that automates version bumping across all project files
- **Automatic Version Updates**: Updates version in package.json, Helm chart, and ArgoCD configuration
- **Git Tagging**: Automatically creates and pushes git tags for releases
- **Version Bump**: Bumps version from 0.1.1 to 0.1.2

## Type of Change
